Test steps:

1. Copy files to test directory:
    _oasis
    AUTHORS.txt.fst -> AUTHORS.txt
    INSTALL.txt.fst -> INSTALL.txt
    README.txt.fst -> README.txt
2. From the test directory, execute oasis setup-clean -remove
3. Expected results
On StdOut (Windows only?!):
        1 file(s) copied.
On StdErr:
W: File INSTALL.txt has changed, doing a backup in INSTALL.txt.bak
File system state in test directory:
  INSTALL.txt.bak matching INSTALL.txt.fst (i.e. unchanged)
  README.txt matching README.txt.snd (OASIS section emptied)
  _oasis
There should be no other files - in particular, AUTHORS.txt should have been deleted.
